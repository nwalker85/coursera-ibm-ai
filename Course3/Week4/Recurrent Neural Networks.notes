#Overview

Most networks assume independant datapoints.
RNNs don't.

Think a movie scene. Each frame is not independant.

"Networks with loops"

They take time and the previous output into account, giving it context and a time dimension.

Applications:

image generation
handwriting generation
automatic captioning of images
automatic description of videos
