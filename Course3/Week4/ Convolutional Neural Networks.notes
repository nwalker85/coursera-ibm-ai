#Overview

- Similar to typical neural networks
- take input as images
- with that a given, it's more efficient
- CNNs are for "computer vision" problems.

the basic idea is it compresses the inputs, recucing the overall number of parameters
this makes it good for computer vision, because you aren't overfit.
